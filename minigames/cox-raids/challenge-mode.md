# Challenge Mode

Welcome to _**The Chambers of Xeric: Challenge Mode**_

You have conquered the Chambers of Xeric, or so you think.  

_**Requirements**_

The Challenge Mode version of the Chambers of Xeric is significantly more difficult than the regular version and thus requires you to have at least 200 normal raids kc before you can start doing challenge mode.  Once you have the 200 kc required you will be able to start doing cm solos or cm masses.  In order to do cm solos you will need a Twisted Bow and if you have that then you will need to do `+raid solo --cm` in order to start your first solo.  To start a cm mass you will be doing `+raid mass --cm.`  

_**Finding a Raid Team**_

For Challenge Mode raids you will be primarily looking in `#raids-mass-cm` or if you have a Twisted Bow you can start doing solos immediately at 200 KC.

_**Getting Started...Again**_

Similarly to before you will check your KC, points and other stats using `+raid`, but now you will also start to see your kc go up for Challenge Mode, it will start to look like this.

_**Scaling**_

Challenge Mode raids scale a little bit differently compared to Normal raids and that's to keep them challenging.  The raids will still get faster based on gear and KC with your minion reaching the maximum point boost by 100 Challenge mode kc as well as reaching time to obtain Dust or Kits by 50kc for Solos or 75kc for Masses and Maximum time boost at 75kc for Solos.  You will also find that you will be using the same amount of brews/restores and stamina's as you were using when you stopped doing normal raids at 200kc.

_**Loot**_

Now that you are in Challenge Mode you will start to see more drops unique to this version of the Chambers.  You will still be seeing the Purple square for the Normal unique drops such as Twisted bow or a Prayer scroll, but you will also now be seeing a purple square for the Metamorphic dust pets that drop separately after you have received the dust.  If you receive a Blue square next to your spoiler that means you have received the Metamorphic dust and now have a chance per raid to receive the Morphed pets.  If you receive a Green square next to your spoiler that means you have received a Twisted Ancestral Kit that can be added to your regular ancestral pieces to make them Twisted.  In challenge modes you also have a chance to receive what is known as a "disco light."  This is when you receive more than 1 drop from the special tables that could be a purple square or a blue square or purple and green, or even all 3 at once which is extremely rare.
