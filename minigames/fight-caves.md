# Fight Caves

You can now challenge the Fight Caves and TzTok-Jad to recieve a fire cape, tokkul, and the TzRek-Jad pet using the `+fightcaves` command. Requirements: total +160 range bonus equipped to your range gear setup, 43 prayer, 10x Prayer Potion \(4\), 4x Super Restore \(4\), and 6x Saradomin Brew \(4\) per attempt, some of which may be returned to you should you fail before the final wave. You can make the 4 dose potions from 3, 2, and 1 dose drops using the `+decant` command. Better range gear will reduce the time each attempt takes, as will total Jad kc. Having a Saradomin Godsword equipped in your melee gear setup will reduce your chances of dying before Jad by 4%, and the number of total attempts you have made will determine your chances of killing Jad when he is reached.

If you have extra fire capes, you can gamble them for an additional roll at the TzRek-Jad pet using the `+capegamble` command.
