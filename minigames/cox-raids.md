# Cox/Raids

Welcome to _**The Chambers of Xeric**_.  

The raids are tough but can give you some highly sought after and valuable rewards, such as the Twisted Bow or even the Metamorphic Dust.

_**Requirements**_ 

Base 80 Combat stats and 70 Prayer. 55 Farming and 78 Herblore are also required if you intend to do solos, if you only intend to mass for your kills, as long as a member of your party meets those requirements you will not need to have them.

It is highly recommended that you have the best possible Melee, Range and Mage gear you can acquire and to equip them in their respective setups.  You can still participate with less than the best gear but you will be more likely to receive less points than somebody with max gear as well as making your times slower the worse your gear is.  

Below is a current image of what the best in slot gear is for every slot, Not including gear received from the raids, IE Ancestral/Kodai.  It would also be beneficial to you to have a BGS or DWH in your bank as that is a hidden benefit that helps to improve your raid times.

Make sure to have your stamina potions, saradomin brews and super restores ready as you will need them.
