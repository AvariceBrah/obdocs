# Barbarian Assault

Challenge waves of penance monsters with a teammate to unlock the rewards from Barbarian Assault. BA in the bot works a bit differently than BA in OSRS as it was modified to be easier to find teams and earn points. The `+BA start` command will begin a two minute timer during which the other member of your group can join using the emoji interface. There are no defined roles or role-specific honour levels, there aren't even specific waves. At random, one member of the team will be selected as the Fighter, and that member's melee strength bonus will provide an overall boost to your time spent per wave. Boosts are also provided based on total team honour level and BA killcount. If you have the stats required for the Kandarin Hard diary, you will get an additional 10% honour points.

To spend your honour points, you can `+BA buy` the items in the table below, `+BA level` to increase your honour level up to level 5, or `+ba gamble low/medium/high` and try your luck at the random rolls of the BA gambling table.
