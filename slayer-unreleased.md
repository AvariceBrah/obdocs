# Slayer \(UNRELEASED\)

Slayer is a skill where you're assigned to kill a certain amount of a certain monster - called a 'task', you keep completing lots of tasks to unlock more knowledge on slaying monsters, and gain points which can be used to unlock rewards.

So, in very simple terms to train slayer, all you need to do is: **Get a task** \(+slayertask\) and **Kill that monster** \(+k monster\).

## Commands

* **Get a new slayer task, or check your current task:**
  * `+slayertask` / `+st`
