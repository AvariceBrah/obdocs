# Hunter Training

## Fastest Route to 99:

Note: for early levels, only send short trips, as you only need ~20-50 successful catches to move onto the next creature. 

Polar Kebbits 1-7  
Feldip Weasels 7-15  
Ruby Harvests 15-29  
Swamp Lizards 29-47  
Orange Salamanders 47-60  
Red Salamanders 60-67  
Black Salamanders 67-73 \(risks misc gear top/bottom, uses brews\)  
Black Chinchompas 73-99 \(risks misc gear top/bottom, uses brews\)  


### Additional Information:

If you wish to avoid using brews/risking gear, you can alternatively do Red Chinchompas starting at 63.

Herbi is an option at 80 Hunter/31 Herblore, with rates up to 160k xp/hr with staminas, ~125k without.

Another option is Aerial Fishing, requiring 35 Hunter/43 Fishing, which is the best method if you want both 99s.
