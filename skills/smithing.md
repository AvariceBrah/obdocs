# Smithing

You can train Smithing using `+smith` & `+smelt` `+smelt [quantity] <bar>`, for example `+smelt 50 bronze bar` `+smith [quantity] <item>`, for example `+smith adamant dart tips`

Smithing is one of the more useful skills on the bot, because it is required to create Godswords and such!

You can recieve a boost to gold bar smelting xp rates by equipping the goldsmith gauntlets which increases the xp/bar from 22.5 to 56.2.
