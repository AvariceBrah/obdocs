# Agility

You can train Agility using `+laps [quantity] <course>`, for example `+laps 10 canifis`.

Agility rewards you with marks of grace which you can use to buy Graceful equipment, using the command `+create graceful` or `+create graceful (piece).`  You may also spend your marks of grace on amylase packs using the command `+buy amylase pack` which will give you 100 amylase crystals per 10 marks.

Alternatively you may train agility with `+sepulchre`, requiring level 52 agility as well as a full set of graceful. You will progressively get better at plundering the sepulchre as your agility level increases, peaking at 92 agility. 

Another option to train agility is through the Brimhaven Agility Arena using `+agilityarena`, this activity will reward you with Agility tickets with which you can purchase cosmetic rewards as well as exchange them for XP.  You can read more on these alternative methods of training below.

Agility is also required for a variety of other things that you will find yourself having to train it in order to participate.  You are required to have 70 agility for Saradomin Godwars, 50 Agility in order to traverse the Rogues' Den to acquire the Rogues' Outfit, unlocking a shortcut at 80 making the activity 40% faster, and 15 Agility in order to learn the ways of Barbarian Fishing from Otto.[
