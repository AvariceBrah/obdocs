# Crafting

You can train Crafting with the `+tan` and `+craft` command. For example, `+craft 100 leather gloves`. To start training Crafting, you will probably want to first kill cows for cowhide, then turn the cowhide into leather using `+tan leather`, then craft leather gloves from those. Alternatively, you can also buy these items from our grand-exchange channel.

To see all the items you can craft, check the [Crafting Wiki Page](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Crafting) - most of the items are in the bot, with the exact same level and item requirements.
