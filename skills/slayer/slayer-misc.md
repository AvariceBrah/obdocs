# Misc Info & FAQ

### FAQ

**Q: Why am I using so many cannonballs?**  
A: Cannonballs are used at 16 per minute in single combat areas and 60 per minute in multi areas. The multi value will likely go down to 50 soon. This is intentional. XP works out to similar as in game.



### Konar specific

Konar assigns tasks to a specific location just like in game, therefore you may not be able to kill your relevant task’s ‘boss’ counterparts or use a cannon/barrage.
