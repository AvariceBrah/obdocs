# Slayer Boosts

You will not receive totem pieces or ancient shards if you are using a cannon as cannons cannot be placed in the catacombs.

You can check the boosts for a specific monster by using the `+monster <monster>` command.  
The Elysian spirit shield will also reduce your food usage by 17.5%

### General boosts

You can find boosts for bosses under the [boss boosts page](https://app.gitbook.com/@oldschool-gg/s/old-school-bot/~/drafts/-Mc_OpZ1puHRQ7E2lSjU/bosses/boosts-and-requirements).  
Cannon boosts a number of bosses by a variable amount, the same applies for bursting and barraging.
