# Slayer Boosts

You will not receive totem pieces or ancient shards if you are using a cannon as cannons cannot be placed in the catacombs.

You can check the boosts for a specific monster by using the `+monster <monster>` command.

### General boosts

Cannon boosts a number of bosses by a variable amount, the same applies for bursting and barraging.
